# Group Oblivious Message Retrieval: proof of concept C++ implementation for GOMR


### Abstract:
Anonymous message delivery systems, such as private messaging services and privacypreserving payment systems, need a mechanism for recipients to retrieve the messages addressed to them, without leaking metadata or letting their messages be linked. Recipients could download all posted messages and scan for those addressed to them, but communication and computation costs are excessive at scale.

We show how untrusted servers can detect messages on behalf of recipients, and summarize these into a compact encrypted digest that recipients can easily decrypt. These servers operate obliviously and do not learn anything about which messages are addressed to which recipients. Privacy, soundness, and completeness hold even if everyone but the recipient is adversarial and colluding (unlike in prior schemes), and are post-quantum secure.

Our starting point is an asymptotically-efficient approach, using Fully Homomorphic Encryption and homomorphically-encoded Sparse Random Linear Codes. We then address the concrete performance using a bespoke tailoring of lattice-based cryptographic components, alongside various algebraic and algorithmic optimizations. This reduces the digest size to a few bits per message scanned. Concretely, the servers’ cost is a couple of USD per million messages scanned, and the resulting digests can be decoded by recipients in under 20ms. Our schemes can thus practically attain the strongest form of receiver privacy for current applications such as privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.

We further consider the case of group messaging, where each message may have multiple recipients (e.g., in a group chat or blockchain transaction). Direct use of prior OMR protocols in the group setting increases the servers' work linearly in the group size, rendering it prohibitively costly for large groups.

We thus devise new protocols where the servers' cost grows very slowly with the group size, while recipients' cost is low and independent of the group size. Our approach uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption and other lattice-based techniques, building on and improving on prior work. The efficient handling of groups is attained by encoding multiple recipient-specific clues into a single polynomial or multilinear function that can be efficiently evaluated under FHE, and via preprocessing and amortization techniques.

We formally study several variants of Group Oblivious Message Retrieval (GOMR) and describe corresponding GOMR protocols. Our implementation and benchmarks show, for parameters of interest, cost reductions of orders of magnitude compared to prior schemes. For example, the servers' cost is ~$3.36 per million messages scanned, where each message may address up to 15 recipients.

## Model Overview

The following diagram demonstrates the main components of OMR:

![omr](omrHighLevel.png)

Based on this pipeline, we construct two models with respect to GOMR,
which differ in how groups are formed, motivated by different applications:

The first flavor is the Ad-hoc GOMR (AGOMR), which allows the senders to send messages to a group of recipients chosen arbitrarily.
This suits cases such as messaging protocols (e.g., WhatsApp Broadcast Lists)
that let a message be addressed to any set of recipients chosen on the fly, or blockchains where transactions may have many recipients chosen arbitrarily. 

A model overview for AGOMR is shown as below.

<img align="center" src="agomrIntuitionModel.png" width="650" height="400">
</p>

The second flavor is Fixed GOMR (FGOMR), where groups are pre-formed by their members and then addressed collectively.
This suits applications with a notion of persistent groups, such as mailing lists or
group chats.
It also suits blockchains applications in which transactions need to be visible to a set of parties in addition to the recipient (e.g., auditors or jurisdictional law enforcement).

A model overview for FGOMR is shown as below.

<img align="center" src="fgomrIntuitionModel.png" width="700" height="400">
</p>

Here, we also briefly summarize the high-level scheme notions as below, where more details are provided in Section 2.1 in GOMR.
In our system, we have a bulletin board (or board), denoted *BB*, that is publicly available contatining *N* messages. Each message is sent from some sender and is addressed to some recipient(s), whose identities are supposed to remain private.

A message consists of a pair (*xi*, *ci*) where *xi* is the message payload to convey, and *ci* is a clue string which helps notify the intended recipient (and only them) that the message is addressed to them.

In OMR, to generate the clue, the sender grabs the target recipient's *clue key*. In GOMR, the sender uses all the individual *clue keys* of the intended recipients, or alternatively, a *group clue key* jointly generated by the intended group of recipients. *Clue keys*, or *group clue keys*, are assumed to be published or otherwise communicated by some authenticated channels (whose details are
outside our scope).

At any time, any potential recipient *p* may want to retrieve the messages in *BB* that are addressed to them. We call these messages pertinent (to *p*), and the rest are impertinent.

A server, called a detector, helps the recipient *p* detect which message indices in *BB* are pertinent to them, or retrieve the payloads of the pertinent messages. This is done obliviously: even a malicious detector learns nothing about which messages are pertinent. The recipient gives the detector their detection key and a bound *ḱ* on the number of pertinent messages they expect to receive. The detector then accumulates all of the pertinent messages in *BB* into string *M*, called the digest, and sends it to the recipient *p*.

The recipient *p* processes *M* to recover all of the pertinent messages with high probability, assuming a semi-honest detector and that the number of pertinent messages did not exceed *ḱ*.

This code implements GOMR schemes (AGOMR3 in sec 6.2 and FGOMR1 in sec 7.3) described in the submitted GOMR paper, which is based on the OMR described in the [OMR paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf) with some optimizations (see sec C).


<!-- ## Construction Overview
The following diagram demonstrates the main components of OMR:

![omr](omrHighLevel.png)


We realize AGOMR using multi-linear function encoding together with other techniques. The detector uses this encoding to homomorphically recover a PVW ciphertext (Step 1 in the following diagram) and proceeds as in OMR (Step 2 and Step 3 in the OMR and AGOMR diagrams).
![agomr](agomrHighLevel.png)


The FGOMR setting is a special case of AGOMR, where having pre-formed groups FGOMR allows for more efficient constructions,
and a stronger Denial-of-Service property (two honest recipients cannot be spammed jointly if they did not agree to join the same group).

We realize FGOMR by replacing the PVW protocols with a key-private Multi-Recipient Encryption (MRE) scheme we construct in the paper. The detector homomorphically decrypts the MRE ciphertexts (Step 1 and Step 2 in the following diagram) and proceeds as in OMR (Step 3 in the OMR and FGOMR diagrams).

### Parameters 
- OMR: N = 2^19 (or *N* = 500,000 padded to 2^19), k = *ḱ* = 50. Benchmark results on a Google ComputeCloudc2-standard-4instance type (4 hyperthreads of an Intel Xeon 3.10 GHz CPU with 16GB RAM) are reported in Section 10 in [OMR paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf).
- GOMR:  N = 2^15 (or *N* = 32,768), P = 2^60, G' = G+4, k = *ḱ* = 50, other detailed parameters please refer to our paper. Benchmark results for AGOMR with grou size ≥45, we use e8-highmem-64 instance, 64GB RAM (with a 128GB balanced disk), otherwise, we use e2-standard-2 instance type with 8GB RAM. Note that the runtime of the instance e8-highmem-64 is roughly the same as e2-standard-2. Detailed performance report can be found in Section 9 in the [GOMR paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/534).
